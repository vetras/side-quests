### Workshop resources:

- Graph CMS: https://app.graphcms.com

- Chat room: https://tlk.io/edit-portugal

### Requirements

- Node 8.11.2 LTS
- Text editor (sublime, vscode, atom etc)
- Bash terminal (git bash for windows)

### Get started

`npx create-react-app edit-exercise-one`

This will create a folder on called `edit-exercise-one`

`cd edit-exercise-one && npm start`

### First we need data

#### GraphCMS overview and setup

- Login into GraphCMS

- Create a `New Project` from `Scratch`

- After that we can start building our models

Create `Technologies` from `enum` type:

```
enum TechnologiesList {
    Node
    React
    Angular
    Jquery
    Html
    Css
    Sass
    Graph
  }
```

Create `Project` from `model` type:

```Project
type Project @model {
    description: String @defaultValue(value: "Project description")
    projectImages: [Asset!]! @relation(name: "AssetProjectProjectImages")
    technologies: [TechnologiesList!]
    title: String! @defaultValue(value: "Project title")
}
```

### Try to connect your app with Graph API

The goal of the React challange is to create an app in which you can showcase your own projects on a list, and then access each one individually to check the details on a detail page.

The list is already implemented and the implementation will be explained, then it's up to you to create the detail page and connect it to the GraphQL server.

First of all, duplicate the `.env` file, rename it to `.env.local` and fill it with the GraphCMS token and ID:

```
REACT_APP_GRAPH_CMS_FOLIO_TOKEN=<your token>
REACT_APP_GRAPH_CMS_FOLIO_ID=<your graphcms id>
```

### Folder structure

In each component you will find a `graphql` folder
This folder contains all the necessary logic to map the API request and the `props` you will need to feed every component

### Header component

Try to connect the header component using react-appolo
Map the component `props` to the correct HTML tag

### ProjectList component

Every Folio has it's own projects, let's remove the mocks and also connect this component

### ‚≠êÔ∏è _Bonus feature_ Project detail

Look to the `App.js` file and try to build the detail view for each project

- You need to create a new `ProjectDetail` component
- Connect graphql API with `ProjectDetail`
- Try to render the `Name` `Description` and `Image` ofor each project

### Congrats! üéâ

- You have built your first react app
- You have your folio live!

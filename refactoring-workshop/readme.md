A work in progress with refactoring examples mostly from reading the Martin Fowler book "Refactoring".
The main point here is to spread the knowledge that, much like design patterns, most refactorings have both a name and a use case.
So we need to learn the names to better communicate among developers, but also the use case to understand when to apply each refactor.

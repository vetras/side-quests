# Learn Java Modules

A maven project to learn about Java modules (introduced on Java 9).

This is a sample project with 2 modules.

One module is the cli that runs in the console.
The cli depends on another module that has the quotes logic.

The amount of folders we need to create is amazing!

The amount of stuff that needs to go in the maven pom is even more amazing!

God give me back dot net core.
